# Interview Scheduler

## Introduction

This is a web app that allows users to create, edit and delete interview appointments. Users have the option to add their name and select an interviewer for each appointment. A left side bar shows the open timeslots per day, and the right main section shows the appointments. 

The app was created for the purposes of learning ReactJS.
